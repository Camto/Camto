# It's me, Camto

Hello, I'm Ben, my passion in programming is in programming languages. My 2 most interesting projects so far are:

* [calc=](https://github.com/Camto/calc), a stack-based programming language made primarily for use in chat bots, but it can be embedded anywhere. It's currently being rewritten in C, albeit slowly. The Discord bot for the current calc= version can be added to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=429763238071238668&permissions=67584&scope=bot).
* [Lad](https://github.com/Camto/Lad), a Discord bot made to be funny and somewhat useful. It's a joint project with [jpVinnie](https://github.com/jpVinnie). You can add it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=709644595104972890&permissions=8&scope=bot).
